`site/` is a production (`vite build --base=/teto-pizza-game-preview/`)
build of that exact commit, with `VITE_PREVIEW_MODE=1` set so the app
shows a small on-screen PREVIEW badge (source PR + short SHA) and saves
progress under its own localStorage key -- separate from
`perusonao.github.io/teto-pizza-game/`'s production save, since both
share the same `perusonao.github.io` origin.

Re-run via **Actions -> Build & deploy a source PR/branch -> Run workflow**
with a different `ref`/`pr_number` to preview another branch or PR.
This repo is not connected to teto-pizza-game's production GitHub Pages,
`main` branch, or Actions in any way.
